* [Parallel Testing With xUnit](#running-your-parallel-tests-using-xunit-testing-framework)
* [Local Testing With xUnit](#testing-locally-hosted-or-privately-hosted-projects)

## Prerequisites

Before you start performing **C#** automation testing with **Selenium** using xUnit, you need to:

* Download and install **Selenium WebDriver** from its [official website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/).
* Ensure you have the latest version of C#.
* **.NET** framework for guidelines while developing a range of applications using C#.
* Download [Selenium WebDriver Language Binding](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/) for C# and extract them to the appropriate folder. Require a [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) of 8.0 or greater version.

### Installing Selenium Dependencies And Tutorial Repo

**Step 1:** Clone the LambdaTest CSharp-xUnit-Selenium GitHub repository and navigate to the code directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/CSharp-xUnit-Selenium
cd CSharp-xUnit-Selenium
```

### Setting up Your Authentication

Ensure you have your LambdaTest credentials to run C# automation scripts. Obtain these credentials from the [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/login) or your LambdaTest Profile.

**Step 2:** Set your LambdaTest Username and Access Key in environment variables.

**For Linux/macOS:**

```sh
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" 
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
```

**For Windows:**

```sh
set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME"
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
```

## Run Your First Test

> **Test Scenario**: Check out the sample SingleTest.cs file. This xUnit Selenium script tests a sample to-do list app by marking a couple of items as done, adding a new item to the list, and finally displaying the count of pending items as output.

**Step 3:** Navigate to [config.json](https://github.com/LambdaTest/CSharp-xUnit-Selenium/blob/master/XUnit-LambdaTest/config.json/) using VSCode. Replace this code in the config.json file in your project.

### Configuration of Your Test Capabilities

**Step 4:** In the config, update your test capabilities. We are passing browser, browser version, and operating system information, along with LambdaTest Selenium grid capabilities via the capabilities object. 

Example capabilities object:


```json
{
  "server": "hub.lambdatest.com",
  "user": "LT_USERNAME",
  "key": "LT_ACCESS_KEY",

  "capabilities": {
    "lt:options": {
      "buildName": "xunit build",
      "sessionName": "lambdatest xunit sample test",
      "visual": "true",
      "plugin": "xunit:sample"
    }
  },

  "environments": [
    {
      "browserName": "chrome"
    },
    {
      "browserName": "firefox"
    },
    {
      "browserName": "safari"
    }
  ],

  "TunnelOptions": {
    "tunnel": false
  }
}

```

**Note:** Generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of the **[Desired Capability Generator](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/)**.

### Executing the Test

**Step 5:** Build the solution in Visual Studio.

**Step 6:** Run the

 tests from the Test Explorer in Visual Studio.

### Executing in Linux/macOS

* Clean and rebuild the project.

```sh
dotnet clean
```
* Execute Single Test 

```sh
dotnet test --filter "profile=single"
```

## Running Your Parallel Tests Using xUnit Testing Framework

**Executing Parallel tests in Windows**

Run all tests from the Test Explorer in Visual Studio for parallel execution.

**Executing parallel tests in Linux/MacOS**

```sh
dotnet test --filter "profile=parallel"
```

## Testing Locally Hosted Or Privately Hosted Projects

For testing locally hosted or privately hosted projects with LambdaTest Selenium grid using LambdaTest Tunnel, follow the [LambdaTest Tunnel documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/).

Download the LambdaTest Tunnel binary for your OS and run the following command:

```bash
LT -user {user‚Äôs login email} -key {user‚Äôs access key}
```

**Tunnel Capability**

```json
"lt:options": {
      "buildName": "xunit build",
      "sessionName": "lambdatest xunit sample test",
      "visual": "true",
      "plugin": "xunit:sample",
      "tunnel": "true"
    }
```
